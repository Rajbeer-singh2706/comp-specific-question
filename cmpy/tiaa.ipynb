    "### **What is SCD (Slowly Changing Dimension)?**\n",
    "SCD stands for Slowly Changing Dimension, a concept in data warehousing used to manage and track changes in dimension data over time. In a data warehouse, dimensions are descriptive attributes or properties that provide context for facts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "A customer dimension might include attributes like customer name, address, and email. When a customer updates their address, how the system manages this change determines the type of SCD used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of SCDs**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are primarily three types of Slowly Changing Dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Type 1: Overwrite**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Updates the old data with new data. No history of the previous value is retained.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** When the change is minor, and historical tracking is not required.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  A customer’s address is updated from `123 Main Street` to `456 Elm Street`. After the update, the address only shows the latest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **SQL Implementation Example:**\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  UPDATE customer_dimension\n",
    "  SET address = '456 Elm Street'\n",
    "  WHERE customer_id = 101;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Type 2: Add New Row**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Maintains the history of changes by adding a new row for each change while retaining the previous rows.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** When historical tracking of changes is required.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  A customer’s address changes. Instead of overwriting, a new record is added with a different `effective_start_date` and `effective_end_date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Schema Design:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  | customer_id | address        | effective_start_date | effective_end_date |\n",
    "  |-------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|\n",

    "  UPDATE customer_dimension\n",
    "  SET effective_end_date = '2024-06-01'\n",

    "  -- Insert the new record\n",
    "  INSERT INTO customer_dimension (customer_id, address, effective_start_date, effective_end_date)\n",
    "  VALUES (101, '456 Elm Street', '2024-06-02', NULL);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Type 3: Add New Column**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Stores the history of changes by adding new columns for previous values.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** When only the current and immediate previous state of data needs to be tracked.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  If a customer’s address changes, an additional column `previous_address` stores the old value.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Schema Design:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
