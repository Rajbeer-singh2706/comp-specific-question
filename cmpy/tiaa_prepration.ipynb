    "### **1. AWS Glue**\n",
    "- **How does AWS Glue work?**\n",
    "  - AWS Glue is a serverless ETL service that automates data preparation. It uses crawlers to detect schema and generates PySpark scripts for transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How do you optimize Glue jobs?**\n",
    "  - Use DynamicFrame over DataFrame for schema evolution.\n",
    "  - Enable job bookmarks for incremental processing.\n",
    "  - Partition data for parallelism.\n",
    "  - Use S3 storage classes wisely (e.g., Standard vs. Intelligent-Tiering).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What are Glue job types?**\n",
    "  - **Spark ETL Jobs** (batch processing)\n",
    "  - **Streaming Jobs** (real-time ingestion)\n",
    "  - **Python Shell Jobs** (lighter workloads)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What’s the difference between Glue DynamicFrame and DataFrame?**\n",
    "  - **DynamicFrame:** Schema-aware, handles semi-structured data, supports AWS Glue transformations.\n",
    "  - **DataFrame:** Uses standard PySpark functions, better for performance tuning.\n"

    "### **2. PySpark**\n",
    "- **How do you handle large datasets efficiently in PySpark?**\n",
    "  - Use **broadcast joins** for small lookup tables.\n",
    "  - Optimize **shuffle operations** (reduce unnecessary shuffling).\n",
    "  - Cache frequently accessed DataFrames.\n",
    "  - Set proper partitioning (`repartition()` vs `coalesce()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explain Window Functions in PySpark.**\n",
    "  - Used for ranking, aggregations, running totals, etc.\n",

    "    from pyspark.sql.functions import row_number\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How do you handle skewed data in PySpark?**\n",
    "  - **Salting:** Introduce random keys to balance partitions.\n",
    "  - **Bucketing:** Store data in predefined hash buckets.\n",
    "  - **Skew Join Handling:** Use `skewHint()` to redistribute load.\n"

    "  - Use proper join strategies (HASH JOIN vs. MERGE JOIN).\n",
    "  - Partition large tables.\n",
    "  - Analyze query execution plans (`EXPLAIN`).\n",

    "  - Use **generators** instead of lists.\n",
    "  - Process data in **chunks** using `pandas.read_csv(chunk_size=5000)`.\n",
    "  - Use `multiprocessing` for parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?**\n",
    "  - **Shallow Copy (`copy.copy()`):** Creates a new object but references the original nested objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **How does Python manage memory?**\n",
