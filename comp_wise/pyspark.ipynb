    "### 🔹 1. **Driver Program Starts**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you submit a job (via `spark-submit`, notebook, or cluster job):\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Driver** starts and initializes the **SparkContext**.\n",
    "* SparkContext connects to the **Cluster Manager** (like YARN, Kubernetes, or Spark Standalone).\n",

    "* Converting your code into a **logical plan → physical plan**.\n",
    "* Scheduling tasks.\n",
    "* Collecting results back from executors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 2. **Cluster Manager Allocates Resources**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cluster Manager (YARN / Kubernetes / Mesos / Standalone) assigns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Executors** (JVM processes)\n",

    "\n",
    "Each executor runs on a **worker node** in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 🔹 3. **Driver Creates the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you perform transformations like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.filter(\"age > 30\").groupBy(\"city\").count()\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "* The **DAG Scheduler** sends stages to the **Task Scheduler**.\n",

    "### 🔹 6. **Shuffle (if needed)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If transformations like `groupByKey()`, `join()`, or `reduceByKey()` require data to be moved between nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spark performs a **shuffle** — redistributing data across executors.\n",

    "* Results (for `collect()`, `count()`, etc.) are sent back to the **Driver**.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## ⚙️ **Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **1. Read the JSON File**\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Single-line JSON:** One record per line\n",
    "* **Multi-line JSON:** Pretty-printed or nested (requires special option)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Recommended Options while reading JSON:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = (\n",
    "    spark.read\n",
    "        .format(\"json\")\n",
    "        .option(\"multiLine\", True)           # Needed for nested / multiline JSON\n",
    "        .option(\"mode\", \"PERMISSIVE\")        # Handle corrupt records gracefully\n",
    "        .option(\"inferSchema\", True)         # Automatically infer schema\n",
    "        .option(\"badRecordsPath\", \"s3://path/to/bad_records/\")  # Store bad JSONs\n",
    "        .load(\"s3://path/to/input/json/\")\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🧩 **Other possible options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Option           | Purpose                               |\n",
    "| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| `multiLine`      | Handles nested or pretty JSON         |\n",
    "| `inferSchema`    | Automatically detects data types      |\n",
    "| `mode`           | PERMISSIVE / DROPMALFORMED / FAILFAST |\n",
    "| `badRecordsPath` | Logs corrupt or unreadable records    |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **2. Flatten Nested Structure (if needed)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the JSON has nested objects or arrays, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyspark.sql.functions import col, explode\n",
    "\n",
    "df_flat = df.select(\n",

    "    col(\"user.name\").alias(\"user_name\"),\n",
    "    col(\"user.address.city\").alias(\"city\"),\n",
    "    explode(col(\"transactions\")).alias(\"txn\")\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `explode()` to handle arrays\n",
    "* `col(\"a.b.c\")` to access nested fields\n",
    "* Use `withColumn` or `selectExpr` to rename or flatten\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **3. Write to Delta Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Recommended Options while writing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(\n",
    "    df_flat.write\n",
    "        .format(\"delta\")\n",
    "        .mode(\"overwrite\")                        # or append/upsert depending on use case\n",
    "        .option(\"overwriteSchema\", \"true\")        # Schema evolution support\n",
    "        .option(\"mergeSchema\", \"true\")            # Allow adding new columns\n",
    "        .partitionBy(\"city\")                      # For query optimization\n",
    "        .save(\"s3://path/to/delta/table/\")\n",

    "| Option                         | Purpose                                     |\n",
    "| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| `mode(\"overwrite\" / \"append\")` | Write behavior                              |\n",
    "| `overwriteSchema`              | Allows schema replacement                   |\n",
    "| `mergeSchema`                  | Enables schema evolution                    |\n",
    "| `partitionBy()`                | Improves query performance                  |\n",
    "| `delta.appendOnly`             | Avoids updates/deletes for append-only data |\n",

    "## 🚀 **Senior Engineer Notes (Optimization & Real Practice)**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Best Practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **schema-on-read**: define `StructType` explicitly for stability in production.\n",
    "* Enable **schema evolution** (`mergeSchema=True`) when fields change.\n",
    "* Use **Auto Loader** for incremental loads (`cloudFiles.format(\"json\")`).\n",
    "* Partition Delta table wisely (by `region`, `date`, etc.).\n",
    "* Enable **Delta log retention** and **VACUUM** cleanup policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Error Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `badRecordsPath` for invalid JSONs.\n",
    "* Validate nested keys using `df.schema.json()` for debugging.\n",

    "## 🧩 **Short Interview Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "> “I’d use `.format(\"json\")` with options like `multiLine=True`, `inferSchema=True`, and `badRecordsPath` while reading the semi-structured JSON.\n",
    "> Then I’d flatten nested structures using `explode()` and column access like `col(\"user.address.city\")`.\n",
    "> Finally, I’d write to Delta with `.format(\"delta\")`, enabling `mergeSchema` and `overwriteSchema`, and use `partitionBy()` for performance.”\n",
